# About me

I graduated from the [Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/) (engineering school in applied mathematics and computer science) in 2015.

I then obtained my PhD in applied mathematics in 2018 at the [Jean Kuntzmann Laboratory](https://ljk.imag.fr/index_en.php) in Grenoble, France. I was under the supervision of [Dominique Attali](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~dominique.attali/), [Quentin MÃ©rigot](http://quentin.mrgt.fr/) and [Boris Thibert](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Boris.Thibert/) and worked on solving inverse problems arising in optics using methods based on semi-discrete optimal transport and tools from computational geometry (such as Laguerre and Power diagrams). The manuscript can be found [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02135220). The figure below illustrates one of the problems I worked on.

I was also a postdoctoral researcher at the [LIRIS](http://liris.cnrs.fr/en) laboratory under the supervision of [Tristan Roussillon](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/tristan.roussillon/). I worked on improving plane-probing algorithms for estimating normal vectors on digital planes and digital surfaces.

I am now an IT consultant at [Adentis](https://www.adentis.fr/) and am working with different companies around Grenoble and Lyon in France.

Some of the programs I have developed can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nyorem) page and my resume can be found in [English](/assets/cv_en.pdf) or in [French](/assets/cv_fr.pdf).

On a less serious side, I'm quite interested in the Japanese language, click [here](/page/fun) if you want to know more.
